### **Code Explanation**

This Java program contains a class `Maths` with a method `mathString` that performs calculations based on the comparison of the first and last characters of each string in an `ArrayList`. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. The `mathString` Method**

#### **Parameters**
- `ArrayList<String> words`: A list of strings passed as an argument.

#### **Logic**
The method iterates through the list of words and performs the following operations:

1. **Extract the First and Last Characters**
   ```java
   String a = words.get(i).substring(0,1);
   String b = words.get(i).substring(words.get(i).length()-1);
   ```
    - `a` is the first character of the current string (`words.get(i)`).
    - `b` is the last character of the current string.

2. **Compare the Characters**
    - Use the `compareTo` method to compare the first (`a`) and last (`b`) characters:
        - `a.compareTo(b) < 0`: If the first character (`a`) is **less than** the last character (`b`), subtract the length of the string from `num`.
        - `a.compareTo(b) > 0`: If the first character (`a`) is **greater than** the last character (`b`), add the length of the string to `num`.
        - If `a.compareTo(b) == 0`, no operation is performed, and the loop continues.

3. **Return the Final Result**
    - The method returns the final value of `num` after iterating through all strings in the list.

---

### **2. The `main` Method**
This is the entry point of the program.

1. **Create an `ArrayList`**
   ```java
   ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
   ```
    - An `ArrayList` of strings is created and populated with the following words: `"dragon"`, `"snakes"`, `"snakes"`, `"worm"`, `"pup"`, `"antelope"`, `"toad"`.

2. **Call `mathString`**
   ```java
   System.out.println(mathString(words));
   ```
    - The `mathString` method is called with the `words` list as an argument, and the result is printed to the console.

---

### **3. Example Walkthrough**
#### Input:
The list of words: `["dragon", "snakes", "snakes", "worm", "pup", "antelope", "toad"]`

#### Iteration and Calculations:
- **"dragon"**:
    - First character: `d`
    - Last character: `n`
    - `d.compareTo(n) < 0` → Subtract the length: `num = 0 - 6 = -6`.

- **"snakes"**:
    - First character: `s`
    - Last character: `s`
    - `s.compareTo(s) == 0` → No change: `num = -6`.

- **"snakes" (again)**:
    - Same logic as above: `num = -6`.

- **"worm"**:
    - First character: `w`
    - Last character: `m`
    - `w.compareTo(m) > 0` → Add the length: `num = -6 + 4 = -2`.

- **"pup"**:
    - First character: `p`
    - Last character: `p`
    - `p.compareTo(p) == 0` → No change: `num = -2`.

- **"antelope"**:
    - First character: `a`
    - Last character: `e`
    - `a.compareTo(e) < 0` → Subtract the length: `num = -2 - 8 = -10`.

- **"toad"**:
    - First character: `t`
    - Last character: `d`
    - `t.compareTo(d) > 0` → Add the length: `num = -10 + 4 = -6`.

---

### **Output**
The final value of `num` is `-6`. This is printed to the console.

---

### **Summary**
- The program calculates a numerical value (`num`) based on the comparison of the first and last characters of each string in the input list.
- Words where the first character is **less than** the last character decrease `num`.
- Words where the first character is **greater than** the last character increase `num`.
- Words where the first and last characters are equal do not affect `num`.
